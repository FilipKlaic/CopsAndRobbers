I may or may not have ruined the first attempt at this project by trying to merge, but anyhow we did backup the project earlier so we are still in the game!

Welcome to Cops and Robbers — a simple C# console simulation of a city where Citizens, Thieves, and Police move around randomly.
When they meet, different events occur — robberies, arrests, or just peaceful encounters. 🚓💰👮‍♂️

All movements and interactions are displayed directly in the console in real time.

👥 Team: Filip, Robin & Yevheniia
